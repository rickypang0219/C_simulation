# C/C++ Physics Simulations

# Introduction
Nowadays, C/C++ is a paradigm for scientific computation as they are blazingly fast, though for most of the time researchers sus Python for simple and small-scale tests to provide a proof of principle. However, for large0-scale computations such as Tensor Operations/ Large matrices calculation are not efficent in Python, and we need C/C++ to do the work! This reposotory demonstrates how to **leverage C/C++** to do large-scale physical simulations.
